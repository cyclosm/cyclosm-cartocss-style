* Fix `z_order` value for bridges, ensure cycleways are always on top of
    the main road on bridges. See #192.

    the associated highway.

* Fix a bug with the text of a bicycle parking with limited access not being
    drawn with the correct opacity.
* Fix cyclestreets not rendered in blue if they had a maxspeed below 30 (bad
    priority of cyclestreet vs maxspeed).
* Handles `cyclestreet` as well as `bicycle_road` the same way.
* Render `cycleway=shared_lane` in the same way as a shared busway. Both are
    third-quality cycle infrastructure.

* Render `shop=sports` even if no bicycle specific tags on it, see #163.

* Render `highway=raceway`, see #191.
* Render `surface=paving_stones` as asphalt, good for any kind of bikes. See #214.
* Rework cycle routes render, fix opacity and emphasize them at low zooms. See #160, #182, #201.
* Take into account overloading of access tags to better decide whether a
    road is shared with motor vehicles or not. See #210.
* Render oriented cycleways (`cycleway:left|right:oneway`). See #119.
* Bidirectional cycleways tagged directly on highway are now larger as
    well. See #119.
* Add some casing on bridges to clarify which linear ways (footways,
    cycleways, bridleways and paths) are on top of which other. See #137.
* Render wood and forest tree types. See #92.
* Now uses a semi-transparent layer for hillshading.


## v0.2

* Draw crossings and traffic calming only from Z18 (was Z17 before).
* Lighter farmland color, better distinction between meadows and wood colors.
* Higher contrast for names and minor roads.
* Slightly fade footway and bridleway
* Buildings were semi-transparent, resulting in greenish buildings in wooden
    areas. This is fixed.
* No longer render tunnel waterways.
* Render bicycle routes labels above ferry routes labels.
* Fix incorrect rendering of some area labels (was appearing at one of the
    area point).
* Now rendering `highway=path` with `bicycle=designated` almost as a
    `cycleway` and if there is `segregated=yes`, then as a `cycleway` with a
    footway border.
* Fix for missing oneway arrow on `highway=path` with a `oneway:bicycle=yes`
* Footways/pedestrian/tracks/paths are rendered on top of major highways,
    see https://github.com/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style/issues/154.
